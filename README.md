# 🔢 Java Arithmetic Console App  
### Task 1 – Java Console Calculator | Internship Project

## 📘 About the Project  
This is a simple Java console-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using user input. It helps beginners understand core Java concepts like methods, loops, conditionals, and console input/output.

## 💡 Features  
- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division  
- Repeats calculations until the user chooses to exit  
- Handles divide-by-zero errors gracefully  
- Simple and user-friendly terminal interface

## 📥 How It Works  
1. User selects an operation (add, subtract, etc.)  
2. Inputs two numbers  
3. Calculator performs the operation and shows the result  
4. Asks if the user wants to continue  

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies  
- Java (JDK 24)  
- VS Code / GitHub Desktop  
- Command Prompt / Terminal  

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered  
- Java methods  
- Scanner for user input  
- Loops (while)  
- If-else conditionals  
- Basic exception handling

## 📁 Files Included  
- `Calculator.java` – Main source code  
- `README.md` – Project documentation  
- `screenshot.png` – Output preview (optional)  

## 📚 What I Learned  
This project helped reinforce my understanding of:
- Writing Java methods  
- Using Scanner for console input  
- Controlling program flow using loops  
- Writing clean and readable Java code
